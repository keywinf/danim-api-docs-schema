# Evaluating responses

Each web API response **contains a JSON object**, which will always contain a top-level boolean property `success`, indicating success or failure. The response code will always be `200`.

| ðŸš¨ Warning |
| - |
| Do not forget to include treatment in your code for `40x` and `50x` responses, which like in all online protagonists could potentially occur. |

For success results, the `data` object property will contain **useful pieces of information**, such as the ID of a newly created entity, for example. Its internal fields are completely dependant on the endpoint.

```json
200 ðŸŸ¢
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "here_is": "some_useful_information",
        "dedicated": "to_this_precise_endpoint"
    }
}
```

For failure results, the `message` property will contain a detailed and **verbose** description of what had failed, and why, and how. There also will be a **short machine-readable error code**, found under `meta.type`, to get a more **generic and clean way of dealing with errors** (since this will be much more static in the course of time).

```json
200 ðŸ”´
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Something dreadful occured when trying to generate video 5216c289-96d8-4124-bcf8-a70b7e688e97, itâ€™s a complete shambles!",
    "meta": {
        "type": "VideoGenerationFailed"
    }
}
```
