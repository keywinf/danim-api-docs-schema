Now, let’s say Bob wants to generate a video from this template, with the following **minimalistic dataset**. He’ll be fine, even though he did not provide required “B1”, because he actually did not provide **any** input from optional composition “B” (which hence becomes ignored, see [1. above](#_write_video_create_required-and-optional-compos-and-inputs))
