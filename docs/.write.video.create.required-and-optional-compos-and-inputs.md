| Given that we name **“compositions”** what you see (i.e. separated groups of inputs) in a generation form on the platform, then be aware of this:<br>If you omit an input inside the `template_data` parameter, there will be different cases:<br>1. it is of an **optional composition** from which you didn’t provide any input: the composition **itself** will not appear in the video<br>2. it is **optional** in a **required composition** or in an **optional composition** from which you provided another input: its value will then be empty<br>3. it is **required** in a **required composition** or in an **optional composition** from which you provided another input: an error will be thrown (see [errors](#_write_video_create_errors) and [examples](#_write_video_create_examples) below) |
